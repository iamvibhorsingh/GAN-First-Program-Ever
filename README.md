# GAN-First-Program-Ever
Implemented Generative Adeversarial Network on JAFFE dataset

Trained with GPU (960M) and got much better result becuase of more training (number of epochs) and results are promising (given that this was my first ever implementation of GAN, and how unstable they can be)

I'll try to improve the results though
